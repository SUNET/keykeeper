# Bootstrap

Here is how to set up a keykeeper machine for Sunet.

1. Install Hardened Gentoo on a build machine, as described in
   doc/install-buildmachine.txt.

1. Make a stage4 tarball using the scripts in catalyst.

1. Boot the target machine using FIXME:boot-image and install the
   stage4 from the previous step as described in
   FIXME:install-file.txt.

1. Install the software needed for key generation and key exporting by
   running the install.sh script.
